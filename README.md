## AI Domain Trends
# NextGEN MOBILE APP
Practice medicine like never before with NextGen Mobile. Enhance your documentation experience with NextGen Ambient Assist to create accurate, structured SOAP notes in seconds. 
## Meet your new AI Mobile APP
When providers use NextGen Ambient Assist on a mobile device,integrated ambient listening technology securely converts the spoken, natural patient-provider conversation into a structured
SOAP note that can be reviewed and edited by providers in NextGen® Mobile and automatically integrated into the patient’s chart in NextGen® Enterprise EHR.
## Level up from ordinary documentation
1. With Ambient Assist at their side, providers can shift from documenting SOAP notes to reviewing and verifying encounter details and ensuring they are focused on the patient and their
specific health needs. 
2. Time spent after visit to complete a note will never be the same.
3. With Ambient Assist, the SOAP note is generated dynamically
and can be reviewed within seconds after completion of the
visit versus other solutions that require additional steps that
consume hours after the patient visit.

## Think out loud
• “I think you have a sinus infection, but it is most likely viral.”
• “You sprained your ankle, and we will get an x-ray but I do not think
it is broken. In the meantime, I want you to get an AirCast from the
drug store and wear it whenever you are awake.”
• “You are doing a great job managing your diabetes, under the
goal A1c of 7.0, but your blood pressure is higher than we like,
over 140 for the top number.”
• “We will get some routine labs: a blood count, CMP, lipid panel, and
PSA today. I want you to go for a low dose CT scan to screen for lung
cancer and I recommend a colonoscopy even though you haven’t
wanted to do one in the past. I’ll see you again in six months.”
## Verifying one pertinent positive/negative finding at a time
  • Good example
  Do/did you have a fever? Yes or No
    • Bad example
Do/did you have fever, vomiting, pain?
  Yes or No
